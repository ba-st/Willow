[Willow](https://github.com/ba-st/Willow) is developed using [Smalltalk](http://stephane.ducasse.free.fr/FreeBooks.html),
 providing a simple interface for your web application, no matter the front-end
 framework you choose.

The tutorials below assume you are familiar with Smalltalk code, and are using
[Pharo](http://pharo.org/) as your development environment. Willow is intended
to work alongside the [RenoirSt](https://github.com/ba-st/RenoirSt) DSL to define
the CSS of your application. Some basic knowledge of [Seaside](https://github.com/SeasideSt/Seaside)
is also recommended.
