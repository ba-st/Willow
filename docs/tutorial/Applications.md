# Applications

To create your own web application with Willow you need to subclass
`WillowApplication` and provide the required implementations:

- `YourApp class>>#applicationTitle` must provide the application name, this is
  what will get shown on the browser tab
- `YourApp class>>#handlerName` must provide the application entry point, for
  example: `your-app`
- `YourApp>>#componentSupplierForApplication` must provide a component supplier
  (some subclass of `FrontendComponentSupplier`) configured as you wish
- `YourApp>>#jQueryLibrary` must provide the jQuery library to use, if your app
  will be online the recommended one is `JQuery3OnlineLibrary default`, if your
  app will be self-hosted and won't have access to the Internet you will need
  something like: `(self deploymentMode libraryFor: JQuery3MetadataLibrary) default`
- `YourApp>>#contentView` This method should eventually point to the content of
  your application. This means you must return a renderable object (as defined
  by Seaside).

Now you just need to start your Seaside server adaptor and register the new app
in the dispatcher. You can register your app with:
`YourApp registerAsDeployedApplication` or `YourApp registerAsDevelopmentApplication`
depending on the deployment mode you want to use (more on that later).

You can unregister your app from the dispatcher at any time by sending:
`YourApp unregisterFromApplications`.

## Deployment Modes

Willow supports two different registration modes: Deployment and Development.
The main differences are:

- Determining the type of self-hosted libraries. In Development, you will get
  the non-minified files served and in Deployment you will get the minified versions.
  This is resolved in collaboration with the libraries.
- The mode is also used to change the file handler behavior, to ignore
  the libraries corresponding to non-matching modes
- It can be extended and used for your own purposes, when there's code that
  needs to differ between Development and Deployment:
  - To configure a CDN to use for the libraries just in deployment
  - To implement different transactional semantics
  - Just use your imagination :)

## Error Handling

You should consider two types of error handling in your app. The first is
server-side, so when you receive a request and something fails during processing
you need to specify how to handle the situation. The other is client-side, when
some AJAX call you're making timeouts, or receives and erroneous response.

For the server-side configuration, you must re-implement
`YourApp class>>#errorHandlerFactory` and configure the error handler:

- You can configure a `reportingAction:` that will be evaluated for both AJAX
  and non AJAX requests when something unexpected occurs. It's a good place to
  dump a stack trace and log errors.
- `updateRootWith:` and `renderNonAjaxErrorsWith:` can be used to customize what
  happens when rendering errors with code 5xx.
- Sending `on:do:` you can set up error handlers specific for AJAX calls. In case
  no handler applies the standard handling mechanics take control.

For the client-side some JavaScript is required, because if the server is not
responding some feedback should be provided to the user. You can write it by hand
or just creates a library and use the Seaside rendering/JavaScript capabilities
to produce it. You can see a working example in the [Willow Playground](https://github.com/ba-st/Willow-Playground),
just browse `Smalltalks2017FileMetadataLibrary >> willowplaygrounderrorhandlerJsContent`.

If you want to do it by hand you could do something like:

```javascript
(function() {
  Willow.handleAjaxErrorCall = function(theXMLHttpRequest, textStatus, error) {
    if (theXMLHttpRequest.getAllResponseHeaders()) {
      if (theXMLHttpRequest["status"] == "403") {
        /* Your code */
      }
      /* Further cases handling */
    }
  }
}())
```

Be aware to load this after the Willow code is loaded.

## Libraries

Supporting libraries in Willow come in 3 flavors:

- Online
- Deployment
- Development

When you select a component supplier for your application it will take care of
adding the relevant libraries. If you return a `BootstrapComponentSupplier`,
once your app gets rendered the document `<head>` will include all the links to
the js, css and any relevant files needed.

If you're using additional libraries, they can be easily included in the `<head>`
by reimplementing `requiredLibraries` and returning a collection of the relevant
ones. So for example if you're using the Spin Kit additions, you can implement:

```smalltalk
YourApp>>#requiredLibraries

  ^ {SpinKitMetadataLibrary default}
```

This will ensure the files required by Spin Kit are mentioned in the document head.

## Sessions

For the most basic applications you can use the standard Willow session. Once
your app starts growing in features, to keep things under control it might be a
good idea to have a unique point of interaction with your backend services, API
or in-image model. To achieve that Willow applications provide a hook so you can
have your own "Application Context" easily accessible from each component.

You must subclass `WillowSession`, and hook up in the method `startUpApplicationContextFor:`
creating or getting your application context and saving it on the session.
(Don't forget to do `super startUpApplicationContextFor: aWillowApp`). Later,
you can easily access your context by collaborating with the session by sending
`self session`, which will get you access to it in any component.

## Further Configuration

### Language Configuration

Some libraries used in Willow include language and translation support. For them
to work reliably you must first configure the application language. The default
is `WALocale fromString: 'en'`. To use another language you need to implement
`registerAsApplicationUsing:` with code similar to:

```smalltalk
registerAsApplicationUsing: deploymentModeClass

  | application |

  application := super registerAsApplicationUsing: deploymentModeClass.
  application preferenceAt: WillowSystemConfiguration languageKey put: 'es'.
  ^application
```

### Setting up a CDN

For libraries with an official CDN (bootstrap, jquery, etc), you can indicate to
the application that the online version of the libraries objects must be used:

```smalltalk
componentSupplierForApplication

  ^ BootstrapComponentSupplier online

jQueryLibrary

    ^JQuery3OnlineLibrary default
```

For libraries with no official CDN, you can deploy the static files to disk in
your build, and then upload them to a CDN service.

To achieve this, first execute:

```smalltalk
| libraries |
libraries := { WillowNamespaceFileMetadataLibrary default }.
libraries do: [:library | library deployFiles ]
```

Then, take the generated files and upload them to a static file service.
Finally, implement in your application:

```smalltalk
YourApp>>installFileHandlerAccordingTo: deploymentMode

    deploymentMode
        ifDeployedDo: [
            WillowFileHandler
                installAsFileHandlerAccordingTo: deploymentMode
                servedAt: 'https://your-own-subdomain.awesome-cdn.com' seasideUrl]
        else: [super installFileHandlerAccordingTo: deploymentMode
```

This will make the `<header>` contain something similar to:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://your-own-subdomain.awesome-cdn.com/willow-6.0.0/js/willow.js"></script>
```
